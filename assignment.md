# Automatic Color-Blindness Detection in Data Visualizations
## Objective:
This project aims to create an application with a graphical interface that will determine if a graph image is colorblind-friendly or not. The program will analyze the colors of a given image and check if they are distinguishable for people with different types of color blindness.

## Operating System:
The application will be developed for **Windows**.

## Programming Language:
The application will be developed in **Python**.

## Development Environment:
The application will be developed using **PyCharm**.

## Libraries:
The implementation will most likely utilize the following libraries:

- **OpenCV** for image processing
- **Matplotlib** for visualizing images
- **Sklearn**/**Tensorflow**/**PyTorch** for machine learning
- **Pandas** for data analysis
- **Numpy** for computations and processing
- **Kivy** for the graphical interface
- **Colorblind** for colorblindness simulation
