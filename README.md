# Automatic Color-Blindness Detection in Data Visualizations
This application was developed as the implementation part of my Bachelors Thesis
for the Computer Science program with Artificial Intelligence specialization
at Charles University.

## Objective
The Color Blind Detector application aims to help users determine 
if a graph image is colorblind-friendly. It analyzes the colors 
in the image and checks if they are distinguishable for people with 
different types of color blindness.

## System Requirements:
- Windows Operating System
- Python version 3.7 or higher
- Required Python packages: TODO!
